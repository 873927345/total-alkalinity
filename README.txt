Introduction (There contains a README file explaining how to use the code.) 




The auxiliary material contains the code in MATLAB language to estimate the water column AT from temperature (T), salinity (S), and dissolved oxygen (DO) together with sampling latitude, longitude, and month.


Because the ten-fold cross-validation was used to assess model prediction accuracy,ten results are generated each time. OutputF6 is the optimal solution we need.

Five cruises data used to build the artifical neural network is saved in excel 'original data'.
